# vagrant-i3

This is my Vagrant environment for development purposes. It runs Ubuntu with the i3 tiling window manager. The goal is to have a consistent development environment across multiple host machines running macOS, Linux and Windows.

## Usage

```
vagrant up
```

## Todo

* shared secret files
    * git config with name / email
    * chrome browser profiles
    * vs code user settings
* work tools
    * docker
* improvements
    * vpn connection management (use i3 bar?)
    * improve git placeholder so only the config is secret
* mac touchpad horizontal scrolling not working in vs code
